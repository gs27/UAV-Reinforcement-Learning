# UAV-Reinforcement-Learning
This project simulates a UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) swarm operating in a dynamic environment. The UAVs are tasked with navigating through a terrain while consiThis  simulation incorporates reinforcement learning principles for adaptive decision-making, allowing UAVs to dynamically adjust their routes based on environmental change
